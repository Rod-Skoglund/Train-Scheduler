1. Application Introduction
This application provides a train schedule that shows the name, destination, first time the train will run each day, the next arrival time and teh number of mintes to the next arrival. It also provide a way to add more trains to the list. The data is stored in a DB so it is preserved after the browser is closed. 

2. Instructions
The application starts by showing you the list of trains that have been added over time. This list may be empty if no trains hve ever been added. 

To add a new train to the list, please complete the (4) fields on the form and select the "Add Train" button. If all fields are valid entries, your new train will be added to the list (and to the underlying DB). If any of the fields are empty or you did not enter a valid military time entry or you did not enter a valid number for the frequency, an error message will be displayed. Complete/correct the fields and try again.
